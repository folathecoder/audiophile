## SEO 

Schema markup were dynamically rendered on all product pages using a function that takes in the product data as an argument and returns a customized JSON-LD. 

```bash
  helpers/schemaGenerator.ts
```

```bash
  export const productSchemaGenerator = (product): object => {
  const productName = convertToUpperCase(product.name);

  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org/",
    "@type": "Product",
    name: `${productName}`,
    image: `https://audiophilic.vercel.app/${product.image.desktop}`,
    description: `${product.description}`,
    brand: "Audiophile",
    sku: `${product.id}`,
    offers: {
      "@type": "Offer",
      url: `https://audiophilic.vercel.app/product/${product.slug}`,
      priceCurrency: "USD",
      price: `${product.price}`,
      priceValidUntil: "2023-08-02",
      availability: "https://schema.org/InStock",
      itemCondition: "https://schema.org/NewCondition",
    },
  };
};
```

This function is called before products are pre-rendered at build time.

## Lessons Learned

This project is one of [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io)'s GURU challenges. I have been taking up challenges on their platform for almost a year, since I started my coding journey, and I remember looking at this particular project, wondering when I will be skilled enough to execute it. Well! Now I know! ðŸ˜Ž

This project is by far one of the hardest projects I have ever executed. It was both challenging and full of learning/unlearning of new TypeScript, React & Next JS concepts.
